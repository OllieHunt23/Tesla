### About My project

 Tesla was founded in 2003 by a group of engineers who wanted to prove that people didn’t need to compromise to drive electric – that electric vehicles can be better, quicker and more fun to drive than gasoline cars. Today, Tesla builds not only all-electric vehicles but also infinitely scalable clean energy generation and storage products. Tesla believes the faster the world stops relying on fossil fuels and moves towards a zero-emission future, the better. Most of the images are stock which i have declared in my footer.
 The user has been given examples of all the cars in teslas range as well as tesla's semitruck and powerwall.





### My Design Process
   
- Colour
   * The colours are generated from colour in my images and videos.
   * The colours I use on my home page are taken from my background image.
   * I Used this [**Website**](https://html-color-codes.info/colors-from-image/) To get my colours
- Font(s)
- Navigation (Site Map)
- Final Edits
- Layout
   * CSS Grid with options for multiple areas for images or content
