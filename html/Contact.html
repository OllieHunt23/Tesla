    <h2>Tesla Powerwall</h2>
    <p>Powerwall is a battery that stores energy, detects outages and automatically becomes your home's energy source when the grid goes down. Unlike generators, Powerwall keeps your lights on and phones charged without upkeep, fuel or noise. Pair with solar and recharge with sunlight to keep your appliances running for days.
        <br>
        <br>    
    Powerwall reduces your reliance on the grid by storing your solar energy for use when the sun isn’t shining. Use Powerwall alone or combine it with other Tesla products to save money, reduce your carbon footprint and prepare your home for power outages.
