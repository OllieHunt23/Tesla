    <p>Semi
        ​Semi is the safest, most comfortable truck ever. Four independent motors provide maximum power and acceleration and require the lowest energy cost per mile.
        <h3>Stats!</h3>
        <p>Acceleration: 0-100 km/h with 36k kg in 25 sec!</p>
        <p>Speed up a 5% Grade: 100+ km/h</p>
        <p>Kilometer Range: 475 or 800 kilometers</p>
        <p>Powertrain: 4 Independent Motors on Rear Axles</p>
        <p>Energy Consumption: Less than 125 kWh per 100 kilometers</p>
        <p>Expected Base Price:
            (475 kilometer range)
            $190,000</p>
        <p>Expected Base Price:
            (800 kilometer range)
            $230,000</p>
        <p>Base Reservation:
            $26,000</p>
        <h3> Great Proformance!</h3>
        The quickest acceleration—from 0-100 km/h in 25 seconds, fully loaded. Instant traction control with four independent motors. Quickest up the grades.
        <h3>Safest Truck Ever!</h3>
        Enhanced Autopilot helps avoid collisions, a centered driver position provides maximum visibility and control, and a low center of gravity offers rollover protection. Every driver is responsible for remaining alert and active when using Autopilot, and must be prepared to take action at any time.
        <h3>Lowest Cost of Ownership!</h3>
        Electric energy costs are half those of diesel. With fewer systems to maintain, the Tesla Semi provides $200,000+ in fuel savings and a two-year payback period.
